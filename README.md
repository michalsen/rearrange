TEST Plugin! DO NOT USE on production site.
This plugin could DIRECTLY change your data in an unhealthy manor.

Do NOT turn it on, unless you want to play some fake data

This does work in a limited test environment.
Use at your own discretion as it will most likely destroy your data!

Edit: Bi-direction! front and back

To use, enable the plugin, then follow the link in the Tool menu.
Here you will see your posts, their content and images.

Front and back buttons drive the images to the front and back of the posts.
